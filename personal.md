## Personal

I live in Sioux Center, IA, with my wife, daughter, and cat. My wife says that I can make anything nerdy, which I take as a badge of honor. My nerdy hobbies include:

### Tabletop gaming

I've played board games with my wife and friends for years, but recently have jumped into the deep end of modern hobbyist gaming. My current favorites are [Terraforming Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars) and [Food Chain Magnate](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175914/food-chain-magnate). Challenge me to a game of FCM on [boardgamecore](http://boardgamecore.net). My username is mkjanssen.

### Homebrewing

In grad school, and with the encouragement of some friends from my church, I took up homebrewing beer. I love the science and artistry of designing and executing a great recipe, and then seeing my friends enjoy it. Find me on [Brewer's Friend](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/brewer/45924/mkj).
